Design and Development Choices

While creating the application, I created an account using
Atlas and created my MongoDB database. While writing the frontend,
I used Html, Javascript and Css. As an additional library,
I used Jquery to help me with the javascript codes.
I used Bootstrap for Style edits and Stitch for database
communication.

As a design, there was no special situation in the project.
Since Atlas does most of the work, I contacted Atlas using
javascript and completed all the work with javascript without
any backend such as NodeJS.

********************* WARNING ***********************

I used local cookies while keeping user information in the
application. While deleting the user and logging out from
the user, we need to delete those local cookies. Since chrome
does not allow deleting local cookies, I made it to be compatible
with firefox. You must use firefox when testing the application.
Logout operation does not work in browsers other than Firefox.

*******CAN USE FIREFOX OR LINK BELOW FOR TESTING**********

I deployed Google App Engine because there were problems on
different browsers regarding cookies in local. You can
easily test it from the link below.
